## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ installed
- **pnpm** package manager (recommended for this project)
- **Expo CLI** (installed automatically with dependencies)
- **Android Studio** (for Android development) or **Xcode** (for iOS development)
- **Appwrite Cloud** account or self-hosted Appwrite instance

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cupg
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Configure Appwrite
   - Update Appwrite credentials in `app.json` under the `extra` section:
     - `EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`
     - `EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`
     - `EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID`
     - Collection IDs for: boarders, managers, staff, expenses, meals, payments, store, push_tokens
     - `EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID` for file storage
   - Ensure Appwrite backend is properly set up with required collections and permissions

4. Start the development server
   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

5. Run on your preferred platform
   ```bash
   # Android
   pnpm android

   # iOS
   pnpm ios

   # Web
   pnpm web
   ```

## Development

### Architecture
- **File-Based Routing**: Expo Router with typed routes for type-safe navigation
- **Screens**: All app screens in `app/` directory with role-based route groups
- **Server Actions**: Appwrite operations centralized in `lib/actions/`
- **State Management**: Zustand stores for global state in `stores/`
- **Styling**: NativeWind 4.x - use Tailwind classes directly in components
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with strict type checking

### Development Workflow
1. All API calls go through `lib/actions/` - never call Appwrite directly from components
2. Use React Query for data fetching with caching strategies defined in `lib/cache.ts`
3. Follow the existing file-based routing structure for new screens
4. Use Zustand stores for global state that needs to persist across navigation
5. Leverage NativeWind for styling - refer to `tailwind.config.js` for custom theme

### Code Organization
- **Components**: Inline in screen files or create shared components
- **Actions**: Server-side operations in `lib/actions/`
- **Types**: TypeScript definitions in `types/index.d.ts`
- **Utilities**: Helper functions in `lib/utils.ts`
