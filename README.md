## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- pnpm package manager
- Expo CLI
- Android Studio (for Android development) or Xcode (for iOS development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cupg
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Configure Appwrite
   - Update Appwrite credentials in `app.json` under `extra` section
   - Ensure Appwrite backend is properly set up with required collections

4. Start the development server
   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

5. Run on your preferred platform
   ```bash
   # Android
   pnpm android

   # iOS
   pnpm ios

   # Web

   ```

## Development

- The project uses **Expo Router** for file-based routing
- All screens are located in the `app/` directory
- Shared logic and API calls are in `lib/actions/`
- State management with Zustand stores in `stores/`
- Styling with NativeWind (use Tailwind classes directly in components)
