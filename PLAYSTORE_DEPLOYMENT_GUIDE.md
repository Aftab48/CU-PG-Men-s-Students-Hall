## üìã Pre-Build Checklist

Before building, ensure you have:

- [ ] **EAS Account**: Run `npx eas-cli login`
- [ ] **Google Play Developer Account** ($25 one-time fee)
- [ ] **App Created in Play Console** with package name: `com.aftab.cupg`

## üîß Build Commands

### 1. Production Build (APK/AAB)

```bash
# Build Android App Bundle (AAB - recommended for Play Store)
npx eas build --platform android --profile production

# Or build APK for testing
npx eas build --platform android --profile production --non-interactive
```

The build will:
- Use auto-increment for version codes
- Create optimized production bundle
- Sign with your credentials (EAS will generate if first time)

### 2. First Time Build Setup

If this is your first build, EAS will ask:
```
? Would you like to automatically create credentials? (Y/n)
```
Answer **Yes** - EAS will generate and manage your keystore.

npx eas build --platform android --profile production

# 3. Wait for build to complete (~15-20 minutes)

## üéØ Testing Tracks

Your current configuration uses `"track": "internal"`:

- **Internal Testing**: Up to 100 testers, instant availability
- **Closed Testing**: Private alpha/beta testing
- **Open Testing**: Public beta testing  
- **Production**: Live on Play Store

To change track, update `track` in eas.json:
```json
"track": "internal"  // or "closed", "open", "production"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **First Submission**: May take 2-7 days for Google review
2. **Subsequent Updates**: Usually 1-3 days
3. **Sensitive Permissions**: Your app uses CAMERA, STORAGE, etc. - be prepared to justify in review
4. **Service Account**: Keep the JSON key secure, add to .gitignore
5. **Keystore**: EAS manages this for you, but you can download and backup from console

## üîí Security Checklist

- [ ] Add `google-service-account.json` to `.gitignore`
- [ ] Never commit credentials or API keys
- [ ] Review all permissions and remove unused ones
